## The overall assignment is to cache the inverse of a matrix.
## The following functions are special functions that will assist in caching the inverse of a matrix.


## First, make/set a matrix. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Solve the problem and cache the inverse of the matrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
